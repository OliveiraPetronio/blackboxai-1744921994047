# Retail Management System

## Project Overview
The Retail Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline operations in retail businesses. This application incorporates functionalities for managing inventory, sales, and customer relations, providing a robust back-office system to enhance productivity and efficiency in retail management.

## Installation
To get started with the Retail Management System, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
npm run install-all
```

This command will:
1. Install the backend dependencies.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install its dependencies.
3. Navigate to the `backend` directory and install its dependencies.

## Usage
To run the Retail Management System in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command utilizes `concurrently` to run both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously.

If you want to start the backend server only, you can use:

```bash
npm start
```

## Features

You can find the dependency in the `package.json` file under `devDependencies`:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "concurrently": "^8.2.0"
}
```

## Project Structure
The project is structured into two main directories, `frontend` and `backend`. Here is a high-level overview of the project structure:

```
retail-management-system/
│
├── frontend/       # Contains the client-side application
│   └── ...         # Additional frontend files
│
├── backend/        # Contains the server-side application
│   └── ...         # Additional backend files
│
└── package.json    # Project manifest file
```

This structure keeps the frontend and backend codebases separate for better maintainability.
